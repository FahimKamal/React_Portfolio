        "content": "This project, **\"Blackout Facility,\"** was developed by **Fahim Kamal Ahmed** as the successfully completed capstone assignment for the **[Blueprint Scripting](https://www.coursera.org/learn/blueprint-scripting?specialization=epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate)** course. This is the fourth course in the **[Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate#courses)** offered on Coursera, for which the certificate has now been earned.<br/><br/>The development focused on building a complete game from the ground up, emphasizing a deep understanding of Blueprint visual scripting. The project was initiated using the **Unreal Engine First-Person Template** and the **SuperGrid Starter Pack** to establish a solid foundation, allowing the core effort to be directed toward designing and implementing a network of complex, interconnected gameplay systems and creating all environmental assets from scratch within the engine.<br/><br/>The primary achievement was translating the conceptual Game Design Document (GDD) into a fully playable, feature-complete puzzle-escape game that showcases robust architecture and a compelling, multi-layered puzzle flow."

The player awakens in a dark, abandoned industrial complex and must explore a two-story facility, solve environmental puzzles, restore power, and navigate a series of logical challenges to retrieve a final objective.<br/><br/>Development utilized the standard first-person character controller, with a heavy focus on creating all puzzle logic and interactive systems exclusively with Blueprints. All environmental and prop assets were custom-modeled inside Unreal Engine to create a cohesive greybox aesthetic. This completed project establishes a full gameplay loop from start to finish, built on a well-architected and scalable foundation."

          "**Complex Interconnected Systems:** All major gameplay elements are linked. Activating the Power Generator uses Event Dispatchers to trigger a chain reaction, simultaneously activating the central Light Controller, unlocking the Lift, and powering on all electronic props across the entire facility.",
          "**Object-Oriented Blueprint Architecture:** The project is built on a clean foundation of parent classes (`BP_Electronics`, `BP_CollectibleItem`) and a universal `BPI_Interactable` Blueprint Interface, demonstrating a professional, scalable, and organized approach to development.",
          "**Multi-Stage Puzzle Design:** The game features advanced puzzle mechanics, including a non-linear key-and-lock system on Floor 1 and a major backtracking puzzle on Floor 2 that requires the player to revisit a previous area in a new world state.",
          "**Custom In-Engine Asset Creation:** All environmental and prop assets (desks, chairs, servers, monitors, racks, etc.) were modeled from scratch using Unreal Engine's built-in Modeling Tools, demonstrating self-sufficiency and deep engine knowledge.",
          "**Dynamic Interactive Elements:** Implemented highly functional systems including doors with multiple unlock states (key, timed pressure plate, remote computer), and a fully automated, state-aware elevator system.",
          "**Atmospheric Transformation:** A key feature is the dramatic environmental shift from an oppressive, dark, and tense atmosphere to a brightly lit, clean, and fully revealed facility, providing a powerful sense of progression and reward.",
          "**GDD to Completion Pipeline:** The project successfully translated a detailed Game Design Document into a feature-complete, playable game that was packaged and submitted for the course."
