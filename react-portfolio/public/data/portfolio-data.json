This is the fourth course in the **[Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate#courses)** offered on Coursera, for which the certificate has now been earned.<br/><br/>The development focused on building a complete game from the ground up, emphasizing a deep understanding of Blueprint visual scripting. The project was initiated using the **Unreal Engine First-Person Template** and the **SuperGrid Starter Pack** to establish a solid foundation, allowing the core effort to be directed toward designing and implementing a network of complex, interconnected gameplay systems and creating all environmental assets from scratch within the engine.<br/><br/>The primary achievement was translating the conceptual Game Design Document (GDD) into a fully playable, feature-complete puzzle-escape game that showcases robust architecture and a compelling, multi-layered puzzle flow."

All environmental and prop assets were custom-modeled inside Unreal Engine to create a cohesive greybox aesthetic. This completed project establishes a full gameplay loop from start to finish, built on a well-architected and scalable foundation."

          "**Multi-Stage Puzzle Design:** The game features advanced puzzle mechanics, including a non-linear key-and-lock system on Floor 1 and a major backtracking puzzle on Floor 2 that requires the player to revisit a previous area in a new world state.",
          "**Custom In-Engine Asset Creation:** All environmental and prop assets (desks, chairs, servers, monitors, racks, etc.) were modeled from scratch using Unreal Engine's built-in Modeling Tools, demonstrating self-sufficiency and deep engine knowledge.",
          "**Dynamic Interactive Elements:** Implemented highly functional systems including doors with multiple unlock states (key, timed pressure plate, remote computer), and a fully automated, state-aware elevator system.",
          "**Atmospheric Transformation:** A key feature is the dramatic environmental shift from an oppressive, dark, and tense atmosphere to a brightly lit, clean, and fully revealed facility, providing a powerful sense of progression and reward.",

A custom river material enhances the water bodies, and ambient sounds (natural environment, birds chirping) have been integrated to enhance immersion. Post-processing volumes contribute significantly to the scene's beautiful aesthetic. Cinematic shots were captured using Sequencer and Cine Camera Actors, output as a PNG sequence, and then compiled into a 24-second video using Blender. This video formed the core of the course submission.<br/><br/>The project fulfills the requirements for the \"Unreal Paradise\" final assignment and serves as a portfolio piece."
