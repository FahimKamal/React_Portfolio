        "content": "Unreal Paradise is an immersive and atmospheric stylized fantasy jungle village created in Unreal Engine 5.5.1. The landscape was sculpted using UE5's landscape tools, and the scene was brought to life by integrating a variety of assets from three Fab packs: \"Stylized Fantasy Provencal\" (by StylArts) for homes and a windmill; \"Stylized Nature Pack\" (by Tiny Talisman Games) for diverse trees, rocks, and foliage; and \"Landscape Backgrounds\" (by SL - Game Environments) for distant vistas.<br/><br/>Unreal Engine's foliage mode was extensively used to scatter trees, grasses, bushes, and rocks, creating a rich, natural feel. A custom river material enhances the water bodies, and ambient sounds (natural environment, birds chirping) have been integrated to enhance immersion. Post-processing volumes contribute significantly to the scene's beautiful aesthetic. Cinematic shots were captured using Sequencer and Cine Camera Actors, output as a PNG sequence, and then compiled into a 24-second video using Blender. This video formed the core of the course submission.<br/><br/>The project fulfills the requirements for the \"Unreal Paradise\" final assignment and serves as a portfolio piece."

        "title": "Project Context & Motivation",
        "content": "This project, **\"Blackout Facility,\"** was developed by **Fahim Kamal Ahmed** as the successfully completed capstone assignment for the **[Blueprint Scripting](https://www.coursera.org/learn/blueprint-scripting?specialization=epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate)** course. This is the fourth course in the **[Epic Games Game Design Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/epic-games-game-design-professional-certificate#courses)** offered on Coursera, for which the certificate has now been earned.<br/><br/>The development focused on building a complete game from the ground up, emphasizing a deep understanding of Blueprint visual scripting. The project was initiated using the **Unreal Engine First-Person Template** and the **SuperGrid Starter Pack** to establish a solid foundation, allowing the core effort to be directed toward designing and implementing a network of complex, interconnected gameplay systems and creating all environmental assets from scratch within the engine.<br/><br/>The primary achievement was translating the conceptual Game Design Document (GDD) into a fully playable, feature-complete puzzle-escape game that showcases robust architecture and a compelling, multi-layered puzzle flow."

        "title": "Overview",
        "content": "**\"Blackout Facility\"** is a completed first-person puzzle-escape game built in **Unreal Engine 5**. The player awakens in a. dark, abandoned industrial complex and must explore a two-story facility, solve environmental puzzles, restore power, and navigate a series of logical challenges to retrieve a final objective.<br/><br/>Development utilized the standard first-person character controller, with a heavy focus on creating all puzzle logic and interactive systems exclusively with Blueprints. All environmental and prop assets were custom-modeled inside Unreal Engine to create a cohesive greybox aesthetic. This completed project establishes a full gameplay loop from start to finish, built on a well-architected and scalable foundation."

        "features": [
          "**Complex Interconnected Systems:** All major gameplay elements are linked. Activating the Power Generator uses Event Dispatchers to trigger a chain reaction, simultaneously activating the central Light Controller, unlocking the Lift, and powering on all electronic props across the entire facility.",
          "**Object-Oriented Blueprint Architecture:** The project is built on a clean foundation of parent classes (`BP_Electronics`, `BP_CollectibleItem`) and a universal `BPI_Interactable` Blueprint Interface, demonstrating a professional, scalable, and organized approach to development.",
          "**Multi-Stage Puzzle Design:** The game features advanced puzzle mechanics, including a non-linear key-and-lock system on Floor 1 and a major backtracking puzzle on Floor 2 that requires the player to revisit a previous area in a new world state.",
          "**Custom In-Engine Asset Creation:** All environmental and prop assets (desks, chairs, servers, monitors, racks, etc.) were modeled from scratch using Unreal Engine's built-in Modeling Tools, demonstrating self-sufficiency and deep engine knowledge.",
          "**Dynamic Interactive Elements:** Implemented highly functional systems including doors with multiple unlock states (key, timed pressure plate, remote computer), and a fully automated, state-aware elevator system.",
          "**Atmospheric Transformation:** A key feature is the dramatic environmental shift from an oppressive, dark, and tense atmosphere to a brightly lit, clean, and fully revealed facility, providing a powerful sense of progression and reward.",
          "**GDD to Completion Pipeline:** The project successfully translated a detailed Game Design Document into a feature-complete, playable game that was packaged and submitted for the course."
